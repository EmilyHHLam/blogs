It was the Sunday morning of the last week of December, it was a year since my father passed away.
The thinking of making the year of 2017 is different, my heart was racing.

Prime called me to go interview, then I got the accept into the school. Now what
next? who is going keep an eye on my two kids. The idea of leaving them alone is
bothering my heart.

The anxiety of leaving them to someone else taking care of them, that worries me everytime
what if my kids feel abandoned, what if other people do not take good care of them as they do.
They always feel like they're number 1 to me and that they are missing that feeling when I'm away.
