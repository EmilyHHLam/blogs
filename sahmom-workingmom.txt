My mother used to say that the stay-at-home mom seems to slack off while working mother
seems alway hard working. The truth is the sah mother would never able to find the break
time to relax. They even have the 'visitors' while on the bathroom breaks. They do not have
the job title, but they work extremely hard to 'please' their clients.
