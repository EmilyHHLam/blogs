My kids are meant the world to me.

Having my son early of my 30, I had the great pregnancy of him. He was the joy of my life
I remember I couldn't sleep straight for 3 days after having him. The joy, the excitment, and
anxiety kept me up

Staying at home with kids were amazing. Somehow, I feel it more pressure that you supposed to
do more works than the working mom.

My mother used to say you don't have the job title when you're sah mom but you can even
find the time to take a break for yourself as easy as the working mom.
