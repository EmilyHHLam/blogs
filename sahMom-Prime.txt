Joining Prime was the huge deal for me.

I did not think that I was able to join Prime. Not because the program is hard or challenge
that I would be afraid. I have been been with my kids 24/7. I was never out of their sight.
Not seeing them longer than a couple hours were strange for me, left alone, leaving them
the whole day for four months to achieve the IT development dream.
