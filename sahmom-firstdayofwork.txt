June 26th is my first day of work from so many years being away from technology.
My imposter syndrome can't escape that I feel anxious, scared and nervous coming back
all gather at once.

First day of work was very busy. There were many bugs need to be fixed after
 new deployment last Thursday. My new assignment is build one page of homesforheroesfoundation.org
 page (from six different tabs).
