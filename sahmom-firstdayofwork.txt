June 26th is my first day of work from so many years being away from technology.
My imposter syndrome can't escape that I feel anxious, scared and nervous coming back
all gather at once.

First day of work was very busy. There were many bugs need to be fixed after
 new deployment last Thursday. My new assignment is build one page of homesforheroesfoundation.org
 page (from six different tabs).

 I was assigned the wordpress project this week. The theme wasn't hard to understand but
 there was no error that caused the customerize option. Luckily, the PHP teammate could
 able to debug that I could understand where all the header, footer, and style.css are.
